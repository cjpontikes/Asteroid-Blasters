# Asteroid Blasters

This was a project I worked on with Brighton Greet for class
The premise of the game is a player controls a ship on the screen of an Arduino using
a joystick to avoid "asteroids."

My contributions to the project were collision detection, cursor movement, and movement of the asteroids and stars in the background.

I was not overly familiar with structures in C when we started the project, and would use them when I come around to upgrading the code in the future.

Other features in the game include and Invincibility power up which Brighton and I worked together on, where when you collect the power up, you are invincible for the next 10 asteroids that fly by. Another upgrade would be an implementation to make the power up time base.

Brighton also added levels to the game, where each level, the speed the asteroids fly towards you increased
